    <h2>
      a Philippine dish of fish or meat usually marinated in a sauce containing
      vinegar and garlic, browned in fat, and simmered in the marinade
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adobo The practice of marinating meat in a flavorful mixture made from
      vinegar, salt, garlic, paprika, and oregano was common to Spanish cooking.
      Spanish colonists gave the name “adobo” to the cooking method indigenous
      to the Philippines, as their marinades were so similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippine adobo has a characteristically salty and sour, and often sweet,
      taste, in contrast to Spanish and Mexican adobos which are spicier or
      infused with oregano.
